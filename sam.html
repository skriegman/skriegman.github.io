              <b>Sam Kriegman</b>
              is an incoming Assistant Professor of 
              Computer Science, 
              Chemical & Biological Engineering, 
              and Mechanical Engineering 
              at Northwestern University 
              and director of the Xenobot Lab.
              His work 
              draws inspiration from the origin and subsequent evolution of life, 
              and applies the underlying mechanisms of
              self-organization 
<!--               ("order for free")  -->
              and
              natural selection 
<!--               ("survival of the fittest")  -->
              to the creation of novel autonomous machines. 
<!--               : robots, in all manner of shapes and sizes, that act on their own, without remote control. -->
              These machines can in some cases perform useful work, 
              or they may be used as scientific tools to understand how animals evolve, grow, move, sense, and think. 
              A Cozzarelli Prize recipient,
              he is the co-creator of the worldâ€™s first computer-designed organisms ("xenobots"),
              co-discoverer of kinematic biological replication,
              and co-developer of the ultra-low-cost robot kit Voxcraft. 
<!--               and a leading expert on AI-driven design as applied to robotics and biology. -->
