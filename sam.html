              <b>Brief:</b><br>
              Sam Kriegman is a Northwestern University assistant professor 
              who works in the areas of robotics and AI. 
              He is the co-creator of 
              the world's first AI-designed organisms (the "xenobots"): 
              living robots made out of biological tissues. 
              His lab aims 
              to bring AI out of the digital realm of bits and pixels
              and into the real world 
              as physical robots of diverse size, shape, material, and niche.

              <b>Full:</b><br>
              Sam Kriegman is an assistant professor of 
              computer science, 
              chemical and biological engineering, 
              and mechanical engineering 
              at Northwestern University. 
              His research seeks general theories of life, 
              in which the details of carbon-based organisms 
              would represent a special case. 
              As we have yet to invent a time machine 
              or the means of interstellar travel, 
              Sam and his students design, build and breed robotic lifeforms 
              to catch a glimpse of life 
              as it may have arisen here on Earth 
              or as it might exist elsewhere in the universe. 
              An AI2050 Fellow, 
              ISAL Distinguished Early-Career Investigator,
              and Cozzarelli Prize recipient,
              his creation of 
              the world's first AI-designed organisms (the "xenobots") 
              triggered considerable global media attention 
              and a tidal wave of public discourse, still ongoing, 
              among scientists in several fields, 
              science communicators, and the public.
