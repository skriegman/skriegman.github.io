              <b>Sam Kriegman</b>
              is an Assistant Professor of 
              Computer Science, 
              Chemical and Biological Engineering, 
              and Mechanical Engineering 
              at Northwestern University.
              Sam and his students enjoy creating new kinds of simulations, robots, and AI
              with the ultimate goal of understanding how animals evolve, grow, move, sense, and think.
              Sam is 
              a Schmidt Futures AI2050 Early Career Fellow 
              and the recipient of 
              the ISAL Distinguished Early-Career Investigator Award
              and the Cozzarelli Prize.
              His creation of 
              the world's first AI-designed organisms (the "xenobots") 
              triggered considerable global media attention 
              and a tidal wave of public discourse, still ongoing, 
              among scientists in several fields, 
              science communicators, and the public.
