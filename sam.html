              <b>Sam Kriegman</b>
              is an assistant professor of 
              computer science, 
              chemical and biological engineering, 
              and mechanical engineering 
              at Northwestern University. 
              His research seeks general theories of life, 
              in which the details of carbon-based organisms would represent a special case. 
              As we have yet to invent a time machine or the means of interstellar travel, 
              Sam and his students design, build and breed <i>robotic lifeforms</i> 
              to catch a glimpse of life as it may have arisen here on Earth 
              or as it might exist elsewhere in the universe. 
              Most recently, this led to the discovery of 
              a previously unknown (kinematic) form of biological reproduction.

              Sam received his PhD in computer science 
              and the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award 
              from the University of Vermont in 2020. 
              He conducted postdoctoral research 
              in the biology department at Tufts University and Harvard University. 
              An AI2050 Fellow and Cozzarelli Prize recipient, 
              his creation of the world's first computer-designed organisms 
              (the "xenobots"; together with his three co-authors) 
              has enjoyed widespread
              <a href="https://www.xenobot.group/press">media attention</a>,
              added
              <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/xenobot">a new word</a>
              to the dictionary, 
              and was displayed as 
              <a href="https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/beazley-designs-of-the-year/digital/xenobot">an exhibit</a>
              at the Design Museum in London.
