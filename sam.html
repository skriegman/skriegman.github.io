              <b>Sam Kriegman</b>
              is an incoming Assistant Professor of 
              Computer Science, 
              Chemical & Biological Engineering, 
              and Mechanical Engineering 
              at Northwestern University 
              and director of the Xenobot Lab.
              His work seeks explanations for the emergence of life's complexity,
              and applies this knowledge
              to the creation of new kinds of technological, biological, and biohybrid systems.
              These systems can in some cases perform useful work, 
              or they may be used as scientific tools to understand how animals evolve, grow, move, sense, and think. 
              A Cozzarelli Prize recipient,
              he is the co-creator of the worldâ€™s first computer-designed organisms ("xenobots"),
              co-discoverer of kinematic biological replication,
              and co-developer of the ultra-low-cost robot kit Voxcraft.
