              <b>Sam Kriegman</b>
              is an incoming Assistant Professor of 
              Computer Science, 
              Chemical & Biological Engineering, 
              and Mechanical Engineering 
              at Northwestern University, 
              and director of the Xenobot Lab.
              His work involves the computational design and fabrication of new kinds of technological, biological, and biohybrid robots 
              that walk, swim, shapeshift, form fractals, biodegrade, self-repair, and self-replicate.
<!--               These robots can in some cases perform useful work,  -->
<!--               or they may be used as scientific tools to understand how animals evolve, grow, move, sense, and think.  -->
              A Cozzarelli Prize recipient,
              he is the co-creator of the worldâ€™s first computer-designed organisms ("xenobots"),
              co-discoverer of kinematic biological replication,
              and co-developer of the ultra-low-cost robot kit Voxcraft.
